# Experiences and Strengths: 
During this course, I’ve learned how to take a full stack application and make it fully cloud naïve. This is essential in my career because most applications are going to the cloud. Having this knowledge is essential for the future in technology. As a software developer, I can handle complex problems and be able to tackle them. I’m hoping to work with real world problems when acquiring a new job.

# Planning for Growth: 
With AWS there’s many tools available that can handle scaling. Many scaling issues are from the infrastructure, so if you have a solid foundation then you can avoid major issues. When expanding, cost can be a major factor. Traffic can increase which calls for larger storage sizes. The pay as you go model is a perfect option. The cloud can provide better security and flexibility. Some disadvantages is data loss and attacks. When it comes to decision making in the future, pay for service is perfect option for cost saving measures.
